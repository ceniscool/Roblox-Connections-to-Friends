Place these in a Folder, any name don't care...


Google Chrome:

then go to chrome://extensions/ and select load unpacked (Must be in Developer Mode) and click on the folder that you have.

This is open source I do not take responsibility if someone re-uploads and does some stupid crazy stuff to it.


Microsoft Edge: 

edge://extensions/

enable developer mode

load unpacked

click on your file with the two codes in them

boom go to roblox
